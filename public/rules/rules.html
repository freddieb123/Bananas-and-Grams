            Take turns to turn the tiles over until a word of three or more letters can be made.
            If you see and say the word first, take it.<br><br> Watch out.<br><br> From now on the game has 2 sides
            as words are made both from the centre pool of letters or snatched from other players if
            changed by one or more letters. So your CAT can become their CART to be snatched away as
            TRACK seconds later. Play on until all 144 letters have been turned and you agree to stop
            playing and start scoring.<br><br>

            To score: 1 point for the first three letters of any word, and 1 more point for each extra letter. So
            DOG would score 1, and CORONA would score 4.
